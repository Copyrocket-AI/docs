## **🎯 What to Do If...**

### **❓ "My Dashboard is Empty"**

**Likely causes:**

- Property just connected (wait 5-10 minutes)
- No GSC data for selected date range
- Property not collecting data yet

**Solutions:**

- ✅ Wait a few minutes and refresh
- ✅ Try a longer date range (last 3 months)
- ✅ Check GSC directly to verify data exists

### **❓ "Metrics Look Wrong"**

**Check these:**

- ✅ Correct property selected?
- ✅ Right date range?
- ✅ Data synced recently? (check sync timestamp)
- ✅ Compare with Google Search Console directly

### **❓ "Numbers Different from GSC"**

**This is normal because:**

- ⏰ GSC data has 2-3 day delay
- 📊 We may filter certain queries/pages
- 🔄 Sync timing differences
- Usually within 5% variance is normal
