### Why can't I see my data after connecting GSC?

**Common reasons:**

**3. Very low traffic site**
- GSC requires minimum impression threshold
- Keep building content and links

**4. Recent connection**
- Initial sync takes 5-10 minutes
- Refresh page and check again

**5. Permissions issue**
- Verify you have "Owner" or "Full User" access in GSC
- Reconnect property if needed
